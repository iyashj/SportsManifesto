<details><summary>How does this works?</summary>
<p>

#### From Planning to Playing !

<ol>
   <li> Find adequate number of people to play with. Depends on the type of game you are playing.

   <li> Check for the slots on the respective website of the sports hall. The booking can be made online or by call (depending upon the facilities available at the hall)

   <li> Reach the destination hall. It's advisable to be on time for various reasons:
    <ol>
        <li> Chaning Clothes
        <li> Renting Racquet
        <li> Paying through Smartum (app really needs some improvement)
        <li> We are in Finland. And somehow everything is on time here.
        <li> Time when your booking ends are fixed and can't be extended unless the next slot is free.
    </ol>
   <li> Have an awesome match. <b><i>REPEAT</i></b>

<details><summary>Booking a slot in the hall</summary>
<p>
There are quite some badminton halls in Helsinki. These two are closer to the office - <a href="https://meripeli.fi">Merihaan Pallohallis</a> | <a href="https://www.urheiluhallit.fi/fi/hallit/pasila">Urheiluhallit</a>

The best one is generally the closest one. The slots are free almost every day. But not for the feasible hours. It's advisable to book at least a week in advance to get a favorable time slot.
<br><br>
Morning slots are relatively free, but after hours are booked weeks in advance. (Damn those health freaks)

</p>

<details><summary>Pricing</summary>
<p>
The exact prices for the booking are available on a hall's website. It's payable with SmartumPay - Sports and Culture Benefit.
The sports hall would let you divide the cost of booking among the number of people, and thus you can make individual payments of your part.
<br><br>
PS: There is a bit of a pricing surge in more demanding hours (usually after work hours).

<details><summary>Trash Talk</summary>
<p>
Be creative in your insults. Not mean.
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>How to find willing souls</summary>
<p>
Squash is an unfriendly game. This is no news and thus it's not surprising that you can only play it 1 v 1 (against your enemies).
With Badminton, you have the options to go 1 v 1 or 2 v 2 or even  1 v 2.

Drop a message in slack channel on hangout or in some other group. Saying <b>Anybody up for a game of Badminton on Wednesday.</b>

<details><summary>Gear</summary>
<p>
You can rent the racket at most of the halls for an additional 2-3 â‚¬. This can also be paid with Smartum Benefits.
If you plan to play frequently, it makes financial sense to get a racquet.

Badminton shuttle or Squash balls -
While most of the halls would lend the ball, it's always a good idea to carry your own to avoid the inconvenience in case they don't.
